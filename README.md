## 🔎 About Me

I'm a passionate and self-driven **Full Stack Developer** actively building production-grade applications using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js)**. My journey started with curiosity and turned into deep commitment—now backed by real-world experience in building, deploying, and managing scalable tech projects.

I recently completed the 24-week intensive MERN Bootcamp at **Dented Code Academy**, and I'm currently sharpening my skills by building fully deployed applications that solve real problems.
